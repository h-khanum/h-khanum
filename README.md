## 🌟 Fun Facts About Me  
🎭 I blend **data with storytelling**—because numbers tell stories too!  
🎭 I treat my code like poetry—structured, expressive, and sometimes a little dramatic.  
☕ A firm believer that **green tea + Python = ultimate productivity**.  
⏳ I’m obsessed with **time travel theories**, but still can't figure out where my time goes.  
🚶‍♀️ I have **Olympic-level pacing skills** when I’m deep in thought.  
🎬 I plan my life like a **movie script**, but the plot twists always catch me off guard.  
📅 I convince myself I work best under pressure… until I’m actually under pressure.  
🧩 I get easily distracted—unless I’m hyper-focused, in which case, I forget the world exists.  
🌌 I could stare at the **night sky for hours** and still think, *"Just five more minutes…"*  
*(Ohkay now this is too much...)*
